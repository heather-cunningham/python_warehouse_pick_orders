# Python Warehouse Pick Orders
A Python school project from 2017

## Instructions from Prof:
This project is a real world problem about efficiency in a warehouse.  

XYZ Corporation sells products online.  The company has a large warehouse in which it stores its inventory of products.  Orders are picked, packed and shipped from the warehouse.

XYZ Corporation has contracted you to write a program which will minimize the number of steps that the staff in the warehouse (called ODA's) take in picking the products ordered by customers.
